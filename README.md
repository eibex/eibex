  Heya, I'm Eibe, a geek and tech passionate that enjoys programming as a hobby. Even though I'm usually extremely busy with work, I try to keep improving my programming skills and contribute to the open-source projects I use. I enjoy self-hosting things on VPS and home servers.
 
  When I'm not busy with work, or when I feel like destroying my sleep schedule, I work on [Reaction Light](https://github.com/eibex/reaction-light).
